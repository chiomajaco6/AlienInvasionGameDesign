🎮 Gameplay Overview
The player controls a rocket ship positioned at the bottom center of the screen.

Use the arrow keys to move the ship left and right.

Press the spacebar to fire bullets at approaching aliens.

A fleet of aliens moves horizontally and descends toward the player.

Destroy all aliens to advance to the next level — each wave moves faster than the last.

The player has 3 lives. The game ends when all lives are lost:
